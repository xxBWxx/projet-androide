		Fair allocation is a key issue in economics and game theory, dealing with distributing
		indivisible resources fairly among agents. This applies to inheritance, housing, and task
		distribution. Since some goods (e.g., a house) cannot be split without losing value,
		allocation methods aim to ensure fairness, efficiency, and feasibility. Research relies on
		optimization, algorithms, and decision theory to maximize overall fairness and social
		welfare.
